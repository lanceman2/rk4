# 4th order Runge–Kutta

A C++ template class to solve ODEs (ordinary differential equations) via
4th order Runge–Kutta.

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods

TODO: We need to verify this code a little better by adding a time
dependent ODE case and compare with an exact solution.
